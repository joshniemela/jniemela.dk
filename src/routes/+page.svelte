	<p>
		Welcome to my personal website. For professional work, I redirect you to
		<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://argmin.dk">argmin.dk</a>. This page is where I have
		put various of my projects and experiments on display.
	</p>
	<p>
		My name is Josh Niemel√§ and I'm a freelance full stack developer studying for a bachelor in
		Machine Learning and Data Science at <a href="https://di.ku.dk/">DIKU</a>. Some of my interests
		include software engineering and architecture, photography, and music.

		This is the second iteration of my personal website. The first iteration was built with the
		static site generator <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>. This was a fun learning
		experience having to write the website in Haskell. But the website was not flexible enough due
		to it being statically generated. This iteration is built with
		<a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte 5</a> and is hosted on my local server. The source code is
		available on
		<a href="https://github.com/joshniemela/jniemela.dk">GitHub</a>.
