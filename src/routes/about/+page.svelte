	<h1>/about-me</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Joshua Niemel√§ and I'm a freelance full stack developer studying for a bachelor in
		Machine Learning and Data Science at <a href="https://di.ku.dk/">DIKU</a>. I have a passion for
		learning new concepts and technologies, and I'm always looking for new projects to work on.
		Generally I work with full-stack or backend development in C#, Rust, TS and Python profesionally
		but I also enjoy writing in more bizzare languages such as Nix, Haskell, Julia and Clojure in my
		free time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am an avid user of Nix, all my hosts run NixOS and all my projects contain their own
		reproducible development environments. My <a href="https://github.com/joshniemela/.dotfiles"
			>dotfiles</a
		>
		are also available on GitHub. My hobbies are a bit all over the place, but I enjoy coding, music,
		rocketry (Prior Vice Chairman of
		<a href="https://copenhagensuborbitals.com"> Copenhagen Suborbitals</a>) and hiking.
	</p>
	<h2>Experience</h2>
	<p>
		Rust is my to-go language for my personal projects and I have been contracted as a Rust
		developer for a few projects in legal-tech in combination with C# and Svelte. My biggest
		hobby-project, <a href="https://disku.jniemela.dk">KU Courses</a>, relies on Rust for the vector
		search functionality and for parsing of various scraped documents.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have worked as a Julia developer and machine learning developer at two various companies,
		Juristic and Promilist. At Juristic I worked on text recognition, image processing and API
		development. At Promilist I worked on another machine learning project, this time working on
		optimising shipping routes for container ships using space-time graphs and shortest path
		algorithms.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also quite like functional programming languages such as Haskell and Clojure, and I have
		written some various hobby projects in these languages.
